# Fruit Classification App with Streamlit

This is a simple Streamlit app for classifying fruits using a pre-trained deep learning model. Users can upload an image, and the app will make predictions based on the provided list of fruit classes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the required Python packages installed:

```bash
pip install streamlit pillow keras tensorflow

Running the App
To run the Streamlit app, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
This will open a new tab in your web browser with the Fruit Classification App.

Usage
Upload an image using the "Choose an image..." button.
Click the "Predict" button to see the predicted fruit.
Model and Classes
The deep learning model was pre-trained on a dataset of 10 fruit classes.
The class labels include: apple, avocado, banana, cherry, kiwi, mango, orange, pineapple, strawberries, watermelon.
File Structure
app.py: Main Streamlit app script.
your_model.h5: Pre-trained model file (replace with the actual model file).
README.md: Project documentation.
Acknowledgments
The model was trained using Keras and TensorFlow.
Streamlit is a great tool for creating interactive web applications with minimal effort.
Feel free to customize this README based on your project's specific details and requirements.
